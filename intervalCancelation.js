/**
Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)
The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelTimeMs ms.

 

 

Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35
Output: 
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
]
Explanation: 
const cancelTimeMs = 190;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 2, [4], 35);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
Cancelled at 190ms
